<h2 id="3-traditional-bi-models-and-shortfalls">3 Traditional BI Models and Shortfalls</h2>
<p>The traditional model of data science application within business is marked by the business disciplines / functions known as Data-Warehousing (commonly DW or DWH) and Business Intelligence (BI). Where large amount of data are involed (billions of rows upwards), it may also be termed &#39;Big Data&#39;. The split beween DW and BI (together referred to as DW/BI) represents the bottom up and top down approach of solutions from a technical architecture perspective. DW being the bottom-up approach of the design and <em>architecture</em> from a data curation and storage perspective (and the related functions of extraction load and transformation [ETL]). Whilst BI is the top-down <em>approach</em> of data consumption starting at the business requirements and usually comprising at least data visualisation and often some form of interaction or querying of data. Where DW and BI converge, from a business persective at least - if not also from a theoretical viewpoint - is a blurred line, in terms of a specific separation of business process or technology application.</p>
<p>Although the distinction between DW and BI per se. may be unclear the complete stack of technologies, processes and methodology is relatively well-defined, even if not always well understood or clearly implemented within business. It has not always been necessary, from a strategic business perspective, or a company to understand academically the data science principals behind the functional process - as long as operationally the components are well defined, properly integrated and a consistent analytical method is used. That said it is clearly advantageous for companies to have analysts and IT professionals conversant in the theoretical data science foundations of DW and BI. Later we will also discuss how the traditional roles of analysts are nowadays becoming known simply as data scientists (especially in technology hubs such as Silicon Valley, California, US), representing the greater emphasis on statistical and empirical methodologies - also reflecting an alignment with the scientific and academic institutions.</p>
<p>The focus of DW and BI in the past has been technical design integration dealing with a mixture of transactional databases and unstructured data sources. In regards to terminology the nature of the differences in data structures is referred to as &#39;heterogenous data&#39;, whereas data of the same strucutre &#39;homogenous data&#39;). A good example of heterogenous data would be the mixture of financial data and customer sentiment. In contrast homogenous data is all of the same type &amp; structure, an example would be multiple employee records cards. This mixture of data exists within organisations due to the variety of data sources, including variety in software package, vendor formats, database structures, differing data types and so on. This mixture of data is what makes data science so valuable to businesses as it is possible to draw on multiple facts to draw new conclusions to steer business decision making. It is not therefore a desire of modern data science to avoid this mixture of data structures, but to handle it in a better fashion. What this means we will come on to shortly. From the business intelligence perspective the additional challenges of data science revolved around perfomance constaints inherent in the DW layer - specifically the speed by which data can be processed, analysed and queried.</p>
<p>First we describe the traditional data science model in order to highlight the weaknesses, later we compare against the modern model in order to underline the advantages to be gained from newer ways of working (and thinking).</p>
<p><a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/01bioverview-151214123258/95/traditional-datawarehousing-bi-overview-6-638.jpg">Image of Traditional DWBI model</a></p>
<p>Although the model appears simple enough in terms of the arcitecture and overall component integration the shortalls are aparent and many:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Complexities within the ETL layer - including schema design, semantic layers etc. leading to complex and highly technical practical applications</li>
<li>Storage hardware performance limitations</li>
<li>Storage capacity limitations</li>
<li>High cost</li>
<li>Poor analytics performance (limited compute)</li>
<li>Slow query performance (relational database limitations)</li>
<li>Restricted networking performance (separation of data )</li>
<li>Proprietary hardware/software</li>
<li>Lack of mobile and tablet visualisation</li>
<li>Technical design of dashboards</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The downfalls created by some of these points are obvious</em>, whilst others present more subtle challenges, for example propriety software creates vendor lock-in, leading to inflated costs, restriction to choose the most suitable business solution and a reliance on highly technical &amp; specalised staff resources or the need for ongoing 3rd-party support.</p>
<p>Many businesses invested in such a traditional solution experience combinations of the above issues, leading to DW/BI functions which can not keep up with the pace of change and evolution of the modern company. Modern data science practice addresses all of these challenges owing to several advances technology and maturity of a businesses understanding of DS application.</p>
<h2 id="modern-models-amp-advantages">Modern Models &amp; Advantages</h2>
<p>Addressing the above challenges can be a daunting task for any business, owing to the quickly changing landscape of options available to overcome them. Underscoring those advancements has been a shift in technology, software and standard practices.</p>
<h3 id="advances-in-technology">Advances in Technology</h3>
<p>The technology changes can be summarised as:-</p>
<ol>
<li>A reduction in the cost of storage capacity (price per gigabyte) and speed (Solid-State Disks [SSD])</li>
<li>Introduction of distributed file (HDFS) and compute (MapReduce) resoruces</li>
<li>Availability of low cost, high capacity RAM (including Flash)</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply put it is now possible for businesses to invest modestly in powerful and fast storage and compute power as standard, i.e. to use off the shelf commodity server hardware. Furthermore it is possible for companies to rent servers on-demand from cloud service providers therefore reducing further the total cost of ownership and effectively outsourcing parts of the support and maintenance of IT allowing the business to focus on the more vaulable data science activities.</p>
<h3 id="software-paradigm-changes">Software Paradigm Changes</h3>
<p>Complimenting the advances in technology is corresponding changes in software design of the end-to-end DWBI solutions. The most obvious shift is the availability for software to take advantage of the increases in I/O performance leading to the possibility of real-time ingestion, analysis and consumption of terabytes of data (enabling Big Data analytics). This is achieved without reliance on specialist hardware, instead the primiary software driver being to facilitate the distributed resource sharing of a commodity low-cost server cluster. This has been made possible primarily due to virtualisation of software and hardware (abstraction of compute and storage resources across an array), distrubuted file systems (HDFS), distributed compute engines (MapReduce) and distrubted task scheduling (YARN).</p>
<p><em>Massive parallel processing</em></p>
<h3 id="changes-in-business-practice">Changes in Business Practice</h3>
<p>Combined with the advances in technology and the software paradigm shift, businesses have had to change the way they approach data analytics. This becomes aparent in the way the management of IT resources need to be deployed and managed, how data collection and consumption occurs and the ways in which anaytics can be performed, queries of the data be made and presentation of data on mobile user devices (laptops, internet connected desktops, smartphones and tablets). These changes are not simply cosmetic and are a long-awaited demand of businesses wanting to address the short-comings of traditional DW/BI solutions. The net impact to the business is more agile processing of data, quicker analytics - leading to real-time decision making. Under the hood businesses require evolving staff skills across IT and functional teams.</p>

<p><strong>TODO How to visualise versus traditional model</strong></p>
<h2 id="5-core-business-data-science-competencies">5 Core Business Data Science Competencies</h2>
<p>In order that a business achieve a suitable level of data science competency and protect its Return On Investment it is not simply sufficient (or necessary) to deploy good hardware, software and business personnel. Rather, those three key components are a means to an end to achieve what the business really wants which is to extract value from data, and allow key business decision makers to gain insight from it. Far too many businesses blindly adopt data science, datawharehousing and/or business intelligence resources only to find that what was emplyed is either not required, not well suited to the business challenge, or not well understood enough to make use of. In order that a business really gets a solution which is fit for purpose it must understand the six key components and achieve a minimum level of competency in each, in order to extract value from the whole. A good analogy of this would be a car with a tuned engine, efficient fuel system, high performance transmission, employing Micheal Schumaker as driver but not fitting any or suitable tyres. Leaving out any one of the components makes the whole system effectively useless. On the flip-side this presents strategic opportunities for businesses and making improvements to the output (i.e. achieving the competitive business advantage - or the fastest lap time in the motor-racing analogy) does not require us to upgrade all of the components to their highest possible potential. Extending on from our analogy, as an example, we might choose only to swap out the engine for a newer model due to high mileage or change the tyres say from slick to wet to take advantage of changing race (i.e. business) conditions. If we are offroad for example, we might rather have Colin McRae at the wheel.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine” (Peter Sondergaard, Senior Vice President, Gartner)
</code></pre><p>For data science the components are not the engine, tyres, driver etc. but rather the following:-</p>
<h3 id="collection">Collection</h3>
<p>Traditionally data is collected in databases referred to by On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP). The On-Line part indicating that the database is network connected to other business IT infrastructure and the Transactional Processing hinting that data is recorded as &#39;transactions&#39;. Simply put data is stored in rows and columns in a relational (usually SQL) database. Sometimes the application or service vendor does refer to any OLTP unit or database, or simply does not offer the feature due to specific application design decisions. When electronic formats are available but databases are not accessible, these OLTP stores might be spreadsheets or data files (e.g. CSV) which are written to in a way such as to achieve OLTP. In traditional DW/BI solutions it is difficult to encorporate data which falls outside of the traditional transactional database format, e.g. market research data, sensor data or customer sentiment. It also difficult for those types of data to be collected due to the volume of data requried to gain value from it. More often than not this means companies simply either avoid handling rich data or struggle to get off the ground with its analysis.
Modern techniques allow for data to be collected in realtime and processed &#39;on-the-fly&#39;, further avoiding the need for a specific Extraction process in the traditional ETL model. Modern techniques also make it very easy to collect different types of data both internal and external to the business.</p>
<h3 id="storage-injestion-">Storage (&amp; Injestion)</h3>
<p>One limitation of the traditional model is methods of data storage. Usually storing data for &quot;Off-line&quot; processing requries a copy of the data within the datawarehouse, and possibly a third copy of the processed data in a datamart or datalake. Since older hardware has slower access rates and physical limitations on size the cost of upgrading compatible hardware can be less cost effective than moving entirely to a distributed model.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mapr.com/sites/default/files/architecture-image02.jpg">Traditional Storage &amp; Compute versus Modern</a></p>
<p>The modern methodology stores the data at the location it will be processed, significantly reducing network overhead and improving BI performance by orders of magnitude  <strong>what&#39;s the study show?</strong>.</p>
<p>Most commonly this is achieved via the HDFS component of the Hadoop suite. Which in its simplest terms is both a file storage and database mechanism also capable of processing various different types of heterogenous data.</p>
<h3 id="transposition">Transposition</h3>
<p>In order to process data it must be transposed or formatted in a common way, this might include ensuring that all financial data is stored in a common currency, or that time and dates use a common format. In the traditional ETL layer this represents the majority of the middle tier. The drawbacks of traditional Transposition (or Transformation) layers is in their complexity. Often a company must painstakingly define data schemas to a proposed standard and ensure that existing data complies and is transformed to adhere to the defined standard. Besides being technically complex, schemas require updating and require specific IT resource overhead.</p>
<p>By contrast the transposition layer is naturally thin in the modern model, owing to the fact that modern data stores offer greater flexibility. Data is also kept closer to it&#39;s point of analysis and due to improved performance can be transposed where requried at the time of analysis rather than in advance like in the traditional model. Since modern transposition layers are very thin the demand on IT within the business is minimal, freeing up resources for the business and reducing costs.</p>
<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>The biggest shifts in the analysis of data is within speed, volume and efficiency of processing, leading to quicker business insights. This is partly a result of both the technical advancements previously discussed. However it is also due to better understanding by businesses of the analytical techniques available. Furthermore, owing to the fact that less time and attention needs to be spent on hardware maintenance and ETL implementations - more attention can be devoted to the analysis proceedures.</p>

<h3 id="big-data-hadoop">Big Data &amp; Hadoop</h3>
<p>One exciting opportunity which arguably should not be missed by companies is that of big data analytics. Big data is an opportunity for a company to get a competitive edge over its competitiors and to better understand its customers. These opportunities are real and are a result of the ability for a business to consume vast amounts of data, which previously would have been an impossible task.</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Big Data will spell the death of customer segmentation and force the marketer to understand each customer as an individual within 18 months or risk being left in the dust.” (Ginni Rometty, CEO, IBM)

“The world is one big data problem.” (Andrew McAfee)

“Without big data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the web like deer on a freeway.” (Geoffrey Moore, author and consultant)
</code></pre><p>Whilst there is a certain degree of hype surrounding Big Data the excitement is owning to the fact that with very minimumal resources it is possible to get answers to previously unanswered questions. An average laptop computer is capable of processing tens of millions of data rows in seconds, a few servers on a distributed engine billions of rows. Considering there are only 8 billion people on the planet it is possible for a company of any size to ask a question of every single person on the planet and get an answer instantly.</p>
<p>Commonly Big Data is implemented using the Hadoop suite of tools, which has the backing of Yahoo!, Google and Apache Foundation (makers of 30% of the web&#39;s software server technology). Whilst other tools are avilable the advantage of Hadoop is its open licensing model - effectively making it free software. Free as in cost, and free as in not tied down to a vendor. This effectively levels the playing field of the traditional database providers such as Oracle, SAP and IBM and is forcing those vendors to offer Hadoop not just as a value add but as an alternative to their own proprietary systems.</p>
<p>Going with a Hadoop based system is always the reference path, simply because of how the Hadoop suite has become the defacto indsutry standard. By choosing to adopt a Big Data or analytics platform which isn&#39;t at a minimum compatible with the main Hadoop components effictively means to become shut off from a vibrate growing ecosystem supported by vast numbers of talented developers, analysts and data scientists, it would also be like running a road car on a combustible fule that isn&#39;t petrol or diesel, whilst it is possible and may offer some attractive benefits for the vast majority of businesses this would make it&#39;s Big Data journey extremely challenging to say the least. Of course, following the trend isn&#39;t always the right thing to do.</p>

<h3 id="open-vs-proprietary">Open vs. Proprietary</h3>
<p>Another of the choices faced by companies on their data science journey is whether to embrace open software and technology or adopt a proprietary stack. In the past whilst it has been tempting for companies to consider opensource software it has not always been entirely viable and few companies took the plunge. Datascience however affords a strong opportunity to work with open technology across the complete stack including opensource software, open cloud technologies (including software defined networking). From a data science perspective some of the open technologies include the aforementined Hadoop stack, R Stuido and Python as computational and analytical tools and visualisation and publishing tools commonly built around displaying responsive layout (i.e. content automatically fitting and self-tailored to the screen size on the device displaying it).</p>
<h3 id="python-r">Python &amp; R</h3>
<p>Two other suites of software used with the data science armory is that of an open and versatile analytical engine built on statisc and mathematics built also encorporating general programming abilities, and designed to work directly with data rather than more generic programming objects.</p>
<p>To the business the impact is that of a transition away from propritary statistical and analytical packages such as Excel and IBM SPSS / Rational. Either Python &amp; R are obvious choices (along with Scala).</p>
<p>The choice here is more subtle than either/or and the ultimate decision will depend on the aims of the business, its strategic objectives and which language has great community support for the industry within which the business operates. Often a mix of the two can be used and ultimate the data science team with the business will have a strong say in which tools they choose to adopt. The decision by the business should not be glossed over however as there are wider business implications.</p>
<p>One important aspect of Python or R code is the ability for interactive worksheets to be created allowing the business consumers of data, e.g. the marketing manager, finance director or CEO to reproduce technically advanced computations and modify relevant parameters to thier content. These workbooks may be published as intranet or web assets, distributed about the business and built upon to enable collaboration between cross-functional teams.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Any review of data science would not be complete without at least a cursory overview of machine learning and the impact on business. Machine learning (ML) is a discipline which incorporates scientific experimentation, statistical methods, programming and data feedback loops. Its name comes from the resultant ability of code to effectively learn through optimising decision algorithms. Large vendors such as Microsoft and IBM offer cloud machine learning platforms for companies seeking to dip their toe in the ML ocean. These tools offer data scientists and analysts access to distributed compute as standard, graphic representations of algorithms &amp; workflows and access to proprietary R and Phyton libraries, as well as allowing extensible plugins.</p>
<p>The impact of machine learning on businesses is that complex data optimisations and simulations can be set up and run over time to form a constantly evolving analytical engine which naturally improves in perfomance over time. Examples of ML include the ability for a bank to detect with a defined level of confidence fraud transactions, or a medical provider the diagnosis of a specific disease within a patient, or a retailer to form an accurate predictive model of customer shopping behaviour.</p>
